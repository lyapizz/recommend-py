Don't know which film to watch tonight? Use recommend-py to get it.

**Link to the service:**

**How to deploy by youself:**

1) Download the source code,
2) Download MongoDB server and start it
3) Start django server by: python manage.py runserver
4) More rating, more precise result.



Already in new release:
+ DB to store users and films. Currently I consider mongoDB for it
- User Interface for voting for a film
- New modern films, currently all films in db are below 2000 year.
